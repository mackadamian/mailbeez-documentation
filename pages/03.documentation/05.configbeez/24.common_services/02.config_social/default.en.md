## Social Sharing Links in Email

As a common service the Social Sharing links give your customers the option to share your products on Facebook, Twitter, or Google+ with a single click, enabling you to leverage the power of social media within your eCommerce email marketing campaigns!

Fully configurable, *you* choose which social network links will display to your customers by turning them on and off, thereby controlling the networks they can share with.

>>>>>by default the social sharing link are not include in responsive email template to keep them as clean as possible


The following example shows how to integrate the social sharing - in this case the "tiny" template - elements into your product list template using `{$products[product].social_tiny}`: 

```text
{section name=product loop=$products max=$max_products}
(...)
   {$products[product].social_tiny}
(...)
{/section}
```

**Important**: the `{$products[product].social_tiny}` Tag only works within the `products` loop as product data is added to the share links.
