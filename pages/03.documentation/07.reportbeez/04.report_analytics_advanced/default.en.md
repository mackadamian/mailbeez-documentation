### Detail Reports - (filtering)
Lets you drill-down to analyze subsets of your email sends. This is a filtering of the data that appears in a given report view. Click on the segment to initiate the filter, click again to remove it. Filter by emails sent, open rate, open rate (mobile), click rate, ordered, and by email type and date.

Use the **Date picker** to filter by date. It allows you to select records to analyze between a specified date range. View report data by any timeframe desired, from 1 day to the entire period of time for which data exists, or any part thereof. The date range feature makes it easy to specify either a standard timeframe (such as a week, month, or year), or any custom timeframe.
