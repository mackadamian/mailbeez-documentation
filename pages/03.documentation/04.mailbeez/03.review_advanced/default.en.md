**Turbo charge your eCommerce store’s product reviews, and increase conversion rates with the Mailbeez Review Reminder module with Auto-login. **

Once a customer has paid and received their purchase from your store, they really have no motivation to return at a later date to write a product review. Whilst one or two of your customers will perhaps have a review mindset developed from frequenting larger, more established online stores, unfortunately they will always be in the minority.

**The Mailbeez Way!**

The solution for a lack of product reviews from your store is to get proactive. To this end, Mailbeez offers you an easy to set up, fully automated solution in ‘Review Reminder Advanced’. This solution is designed to email your customers at specific intervals, and invites them to write product reviews for their recent purchase(s); all done in a non-invasive and intelligent manner.

Depending on your store’s image settings, you might need to customize the templates to get the best results. However, you can also create your own templates, and the module will add them to the template selector.

#### Take a look at some more great features

**Easy Reviewing with Auto-Login – Get more reviews!**

They've bought and liked your products, but customers do not need to jump through hoops just to give you their feedback. If you can make the review process as simple as possible, you'll be rewarded with more and better reviews. Luckily, Mailbeez has got you covered, as the Review Reminder module boasts a seamless ‘auto login’ feature, that automatically signs in customers after they click through from the request email. This allows customers to start writing product review straight away. No need to worry about security either. The auto login feature is only valid for writing reviews. This means that other pages on the site, like the “my account” area, still requires a manual login with valid user credentials. 

To enable the autologin-functionality, you need to modify your shopping-cart system’s “product\_reviews\_write” page by adding just 2 lines of code. The download package comes with instructions for all platforms (osCommerce, ZenCart, xtCommerce) to assist you with this.

#### Up the tempo with the Review-o-Meter

Follow your rate of review from the Mailbeez Dashboard on the admin panel of your shopping-cart system using the “[Review-O-Meter](/documentation/dashboardbeez/dashboard_review_o_meter/ "Review-O-Meter")” (already part of your MailBeez platform). This handy visual widget gives you direct feedback on how your store is performing with regards to posted reviews for your products. Fun and informative, it’s just one of the many ways Mailbeez can assist you in increasing both conversion rates and product reviews... and consequently revenue.
