This module has been developed for professional application of the free add-on [Shoprating](/documentation/configbeez/config_shopvoting/).

The shopvoting module allows your customers to rate your store. You can edit these ratings in your store admin and display them on your storefront.

This module allows store-owners to automatically invite their customers to rate their store.

In comparison to the free version the Shoprating Invitation advanced module offers a range of features like auto-login and recognition of regular customers which will generate up to twice as many ratings

This module allows you to dynamically integrate the rating in real time into your MailBeez Emails e.g. [Winback Advanced](/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced/)
