This MailBeez Module allows you to contact customers who have an account, but no purchases.


**Great for stores just starting out**

Whilst Nopurchase Simple does not include the more advanced features of the [Nopurchase Advanced with Coupons](/documentation/mailbeez/nopurchase_advanced/ "Nopurchase Advanced") - a module we recommend you upgrade to once you've tested Nopurchase Simple for a few days - nevertheless it will allow you to start automatically emailing customers who have no purchases straight out of the box.

**Easily installed and configured**

Like all Mailbeez modules, even the extremely powerful Advanced modules, Nopurchase Simple is very simple to install and configure. Installation is usually a case of just transferring a few files into your FTP, whilst configuration is via the Mailbeez module controls in your store’s admin area; an environment you are already familiar very familiar with.
