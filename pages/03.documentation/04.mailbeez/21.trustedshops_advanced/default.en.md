**Get the most out of your Trustedshops subscription**

## Advanced Features

This advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve the process of inviting customers to provide a rating of your store on Trustedshops:

## Multiple order status

Do you use different order status? No problem, you decide which order status you want the module to react on.

## Delay times for international orders

Shipping to international customers typically takes a couple days longer. To avoid sending a rating invite before delivery, you can define an additional delay for orders shipping to countries other than your own!

The module automatically applies this delay to all orders which are shipped to a country, which is different from the home country you configured in your shopping-cart system.

## Recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an invite to rate on Trustpilot? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between two invites and you're done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decide whether to wait or to send a new invite.

### Want to integrate your valuable Trustedshop ratings with your marketing efforts?

Using the [Trustedshops Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustedshops_rss_importer/) you can easily integrate your Trustedshops-Ratings with your shopping-cart - in a way that makes this "unique" and fresh content visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated marketing emails!
