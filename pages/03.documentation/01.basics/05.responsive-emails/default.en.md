##What are responsive Emails?
  
Responsive emails adapt to the screen size of the device on which they are being displayed. For example, on a notebook, they might appear as a "normal" email, while on mobile devices the layout changes: text is displayed larger; columns break into rows; buttons become bigger - delivering an improved user experience on smaller device screens! 


## Did you know:

- **More than 47% of email opens** happen on **mobile devices**
- **80% of people deletes an email if it doesn't look good on their mobile device.**
